#### Project Leadership and Staffing ####
QualiMente can lead your project and train your staff to build, implement, and sustain your software system. 

Alternatively, we can handle all of the build, implementation, and sustaining responsibilities for the project and resulting system.

#### Agile Practice Infusion ####
We can help your team become more agile by facilitating the introduction of:

* project management using Scrum
* test-driven and test-now development
* requirements gathing via User Stories
* requirements verification via executable documentation


#### Targeted Problem Solving ####
We have extensive experience with the [8D problem solving process](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_Disciplines_Problem_Solving) and can bring that expertise to bear on your tough problem. 

QualiMente specializes in challenging performance, scalability, and reliability problems.  This is what we consider _fun_.

#### Project Jump Start ####

We can help you get your project off on the right foot by helping your team select a technology stack and get going with it. We can also help infuse some agility and quality at this time.
